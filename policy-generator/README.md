The policy-generator generates a Bro script that is needed to interpret and convert the raw values from the traffic.
It takes an RTU configuation as input and outputs a Bro script containing all relevant information of the configuration.

Generate scenario policies (select desired RTU configuration in code):
```bash
python GeneratePhysicalTagMap.py
```
